Stages
This is the window that hold the components for our app.
The stage is a top level window on top of which we put Scenes.
Scene holds controls and these are buttons and labels, etc.

Our Main Application will extend the Application interface of
javafx.application.Application where we have to implement the
start method and also call the launch method in the main method
passing in args.

// Create a button
Button button = new Button("I am a button Clicked me");

// Create a layout and add the button to the layout
HBox  hBox = new HBox();
hBox.getChildren().add(button);

// Create  a scene and add the layout and bg
Scene scene = new Scene(hBox, Color.TOMATO);

// set the stage by adding a scene
stage.setScene(scene);

// set title
stage.setTitle("This is a Title");

// set the icon of the window and add it to the stage
/*Image icon = new Image("icon.jpg");
System.out.println(icon.getUrl());

stage.getIcons().add(icon);*/

// display/show the scene
stage.show();
